# Review of October (19/10/2018)

## TODOs

- Complete formalization of the problem
- Write 'Related work' section
- Implementation of the first benchmark algorithm
- Determine the learning algorithm robust to the nuisance parameters + architecture

## Complete formalization of the problem

Delayed to the review of November

## Write 'Related work' section

The 'Related work'section now contains descriptions of the papers sorted by domain. See [related-work.md](../related-work.md)

## Implementation of the first benchmark algorithm

In order to perform and quickly iterate over RL experiments, a small library has been developed that allows to only focus on the algorithm itself and not the boilerplate of environments and data collections.
The PPO algorithm is still a work in progress and therefore so is the first benchmark.

## Determine the learning algorithm robust to the nuisance parameters + architecture

Delayed to the review of November
